h1. Usage

This module allows you to deploy your Play! application to dotcloud (*http://dotcloud.com*). It creates a WAR file from the current application and then pushes it to dotcloud. 

To push to dotcloud, a deployment name is required. Either give it at the command line ("--deployment myapp.www") or add it to your application.conf ("dotcloud.deployment=myapp.www"). From the Play! application's root directory, you may then issue "play dotcloud:deploy" to push the current version of your application to dotcloud. 

h2. Requirements

You need to have the dotcloud command line client installed. 

I only tested this module on Mac OS X -- it *should* work on all platforms supported by Play!, however.
